my_learning=""" 
1.due to influence of C i was mainly writing big code
2.as in C course we had hard problems for the base 5 question i thought something and complicated it while it was not 
  that tough
3.coding in python is easy but i am referring for builtin functions and documentation
4.time constraint 
5.raising errors is very important 
6.should be familiar with all the functions as the main advantage is everything is predefined we only need to know how to use them efficiently
7.overall should know the diff btw c and python and develop skills for writing a optimised efficient code
