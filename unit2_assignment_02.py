Write your own implementation of converting a number to a given base. It is important to have a good logical
and code understanding of this.

Till now, we were glossing over error checking, for this function do proper error checking and raise exceptions
as appropriate.

    Convert the given number into a string in the given base. valid base is 2 <= base <= 36
